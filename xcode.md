# XCode

For the command line tools (like git etc.) you need to install XCode from the AppStore first and agree to the license.

After installing just type 

```git```

into the Terminal. After this the license dialog which you need to agree to, will show up.

You can also install the complete XCode command line tools (like C-Compiler etc) with:

```xcode-select --install```
