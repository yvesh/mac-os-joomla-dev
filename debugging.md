# Debugging Joomla with PhpStorm

Thanks to the zero-configuration debugger you can easily attach the PHP Debugger to an Joomla extension.

### Requirements

Either use the bookmarks provided by PhpStorm (for enabling debug) or use the Chrome plugin Xdebug Helper. 

**Webserver / Php** with **XDebug** enabled and remote debugging turned on.
